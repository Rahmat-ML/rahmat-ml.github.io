I am Rahmatollah Ansari, a graduate student pursuing a Master’s Degree in Artificial Intelligence at the Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST). As a highly motivated AI student with a strong background in problem-solving and team collaboration, I am deeply passionate about advancing research in Artificial Intelligence, with a particular interest in NLP, Multimodal AI, and Large Language Models.

My goal is to contribute to innovative research that pushes the boundaries of machine intelligence and helps bridge theory with practical impact. I am committed to continuous learning and thrive on exploring new ideas, implementing them, and working collaboratively in research labs to make meaningful scientific progress.

My primary research interests include:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Multimodal Artificial Intelligence
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Representation Learning
- Vision-Language Models

I completed my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Engineering at Hakim Sabzevari University, where I graduated with the 1st rank in my cohort. During my undergraduate studies, I was actively involved in the University Olympiad team, the ICPC team, and the Scientific Society of Computer Engineering.
